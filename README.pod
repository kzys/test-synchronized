=head1 Test::Synchronized

Test::Synchronized provides simple (and giant) lock for your tests.

If you want to run your tests in parallel, the lock makes your tests slow.
But it will be better than unstable.

You can download the released version from
L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Synchronized/>.

And you can clone the respository from
L<https://github.com/kzys/test-synchronized>.
